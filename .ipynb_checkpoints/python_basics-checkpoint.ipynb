    "When we run a python file by entering `python <file_name>.py` in the console, <file_name> is scanned top to bottom looking for any top-level executable code (i.e variable assignments, print statements, etc.). Also, there are a few Python internal variables set by the interpreter and one of these is __name__, which is set to main when executing code in <file_name>.py.\n",
    "Inside of the if condition, we call the `hello_world()` function, which is defined right above. Inside of the `()` are where we can pass variables to be used inside of the function. We'll explore that soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the weirdness?\n",
    "The point of `if __name__ == '__main__':` is to allow code within that block to execute only when called by a Python interpreter rather than as an imported module (as in another file is using the contents of this file). \n"

    "### Variables\n",
    "Variables are used to store data in memory that can later be recalled based on the context. There are different data type that variables can be, some unique to individual languages. \n",
    "For Python, the basic data types are:\n",
    "* **Integers** `int`: whole numbers\n",
    "* **Strings** `str`: text\n",
    "* **Floats** `float`: decimal numbers\n",
    "* **Dictionaries** `dict`: Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "Each programming language handles variables differently, some are \"strictly\" typed while some (like Python) are \"dynamically\" typed. Strict typing means you have to declare a variable as a specific type before using it. Dynamically typed means you do not need to do this. Python has type hints to give the developer an idea of what the variable will contain, but it does not need to be enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "Functions are blocks of code stores in memory that can be called by different parts of the code or program with variables, or parameters. In Python, a function is defined using `def`and can return values.\n"
